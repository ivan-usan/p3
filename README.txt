Menus work by the way, of having some variable that defines the current option index.

Button b leads to the iteration of option index. Button a leads to the sending the reaction to the child microbit.
If no button is clicked, then the image of current option is shown. If button b or no button, than menu function needs to return True.
That means to not pop the menu from the stack.
